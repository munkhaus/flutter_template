# Routing Guidelines

## Technology

- Use `go_router` for all navigation
- Centralize routes in `core/router/app_router.dart`

## Conventions

- Define routes with `GoRoute` under a single `GoRouter` instance
- Use typed path parameters and query params (decode/validate at boundary)
- No direct `Navigator` calls in features; use context extensions (`context.go`, `context.push`)
- Extract screen widgets under `feature_name/presentation/` and reference them from routes

## Deep Links & Web

- Routes must be shareable URLs (web-friendly paths)
- Keep path segments lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `/user-profile/:id`)

## Example

```dart
class AppRouter {
  static final GoRouter router = GoRouter(
    routes: [
      GoRoute(
        path: '/',
        builder: (context, _) => const HomePage(),
      ),
      GoRoute(
        path: '/details/:id',
        builder: (context, state) {
          final id = state.pathParameters['id']!;
          return DetailsPage(id: id);
        },
      ),
    ],
  );
}
```
