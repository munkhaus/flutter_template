## Performance

- Prefer `const` constructors where possible
- Avoid rebuilding large subtrees; use `BlocSelector`/`Selector` when appropriate
- Defer heavy work to `compute` or isolates
- Use `ListView.builder` over `ListView` with many children
- Avoid synchronous I/O on UI thread

## Memory

- Dispose controllers and focus nodes in `dispose`
- Use `AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin` intentionally

## Accessibility

- Provide `Semantics` labels for icons and custom widgets
- Ensure tap targets are at least 48x48
- Respect text scale factor; use responsive text with `MediaQuery.textScaler`
- Maintain sufficient contrast and support dark mode

## Internationalization

- No hard-coded user-facing strings; use `l10n`
- Support pluralization and gender where needed
