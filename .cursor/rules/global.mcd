description: Global rules that apply to all edits in this workspace
globs: ["**/*"]
alwaysApply: true

- These rules apply to ALL edits made by the agent in this workspace.
- Before creating or changing code, follow the architecture, naming, state management, DI, repository, API/error handling, testing, performance, and accessibility rules.
- If a requested change conflicts with these rules, surface the conflict and propose a compliant alternative.
- Keep domain pure (no Flutter imports), preserve layer boundaries, and prefer Result/Either over thrown exceptions.
- Use `KSizes` for layout values and `getIt` for DI (constructor injection preferred in UI).

See the index for detailed rule files.
