# Flutter Template

Production-grade Flutter template with:

- Feature-first architecture and Cursor rules
- Strict lints (very_good_analysis) and import boundary enforcement
- DI with get_it, routing with go_router
- Networking with dio, design tokens via `KSizes`
- CI workflow (format, analyze, tests with coverage)

## Getting Started

### Use this template

1) Create your repo from this template (Use this template â†’ Create new repository)
2) Clone your new repo
3) Install dependencies

```
flutter pub get
```

4) Verify lints and tests

```
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .
flutter analyze
flutter test --coverage
```

5) Run locally

```
flutter run -d chrome
```

### Codegen (optional when using freezed/json_serializable later)

```
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
